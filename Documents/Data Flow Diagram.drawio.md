***DATA FLOW DIAGRAM***

The DFD illustrates the data engineering process, moving data from CRM and ERP systems to business-ready formats.

Sources: CRM and ERP systems provide raw data (e.g., customer and operational data).

ETL/ELT: Data is extracted, cleaned, and transformed for consistency and structure.

Storage: Cleaned data is stored in a data warehouse or data lake.
